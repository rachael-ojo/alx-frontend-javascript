Introduction
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It provides developers with powerful tools for writing more robust and maintainable code. This project is designed to demonstrate various TypeScript features and how to integrate them into your applications.

Getting Started
To get started with TypeScript, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x04-TypeScript.git
Navigate to the project directory:
