# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Description

This project covers the basics of ES6 Promises, a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises provide a more robust and flexible way to manage asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks, helping to avoid callback hell and improve code readability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of Promises in JavaScript.
- Create and use Promises to handle asynchronous operations.
- Chain Promises using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`.
- Handle multiple Promises concurrently with `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, `Promise.allSettled()`, and `Promise.any()`.
