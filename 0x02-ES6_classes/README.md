Introduction
This project covers the basics and advanced usage of ES6 classes in JavaScript. ES6 classes offer a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, making the code more readable and easier to manage.

Features
Definition and usage of ES6 classes
Understanding constructors
Inheritance using extends and super
Static methods and properties
Getters and setters
Private fields and methods
Usage
To use the examples provided in this project, you will need a modern web browser or a Node.js environment that supports ES6.

Running in Browser

Examples
Below are some examples of how to use ES6 classes:

Basic Class Definition
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
}

const john = new Person('John Doe', 30);
console.log(john.greet());
Inheritance
javascript
Copy code
class Employee extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, position) {
        super(name, age);
        this.position = position;
    }

    describe() {
        return `${this.greet()} I work as a ${this.position}.`;
    }
}

const jane = new Employee('Jane Doe', 25, 'Software Engineer');
console.log(jane.describe());
Static Methods
javascript
Copy code
class MathUtils {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3));
